# Papertiger

Use a durable record when it helps the work survive a handoff. One independently
reviewable outcome gets one task; investigation and verification are steps inside
it. Resume existing records even for a small next step. Record validated deferred
work as it appears, without interrupting authorized progress. Do not mirror an
existing team or domain lifecycle.

## Select the authority once

<!-- installed-command -->

Use `<project-root>/tools/papertiger/bin/papertiger[.exe]` in the native
shell. Keep work in the canonical project that owns the outcome, including
cross-repository work; from elsewhere pass `--project-root <canonical-root>` to
that root's own launcher, since releases can differ during rollouts.
The runtime selects the existing authority; do not guess `--db`, use PATH, or
create a second store in a worktree. Without a project runtime, use the
executable named by your personal Papertiger skill and put the consuming
project's absolute root in each task intent. Below, `papertiger` means the
selected executable. Write through it, never raw SQLite. A refusal does not
authorize removing guards or manufacturing admission; use the corrective command
or preserve the blocker. Only for a genuinely new authority, read
[first use](../../../tools/papertiger/agent_integration.md#first-use).

Before mutating, set `PAPERTIGER_ACTOR` to a concise author label and
`PAPERTIGER_SESSION` to one unique session ID, and reuse them (`--actor` and
`--session` work when the shell drops environment). Set `PAPERTIGER_MODEL` and
`PAPERTIGER_REASONING_EFFORT` only to known values.

## Enter, work, finish

Orient to an unfamiliar authority with `status` once. For a known task, read
`show <N> --json` and resume it; `--no-history` rechecks current state.
Otherwise select work with `focus --plan <slug> --json`, and before adding,
search with `search "<terms>" --plan <slug> --compact`; follow continuations
when relevant. Another session's pickup is advisory: not a lock, and no reason
to ask permission for requested work.

```text
papertiger start <N> --why "Why this work resumes" --json
papertiger add "Outcome" --plan <slug> --start --intent "Standalone purpose" --intent-source user --why "Why now" --json
papertiger done <N> --result "Outcome and verification" --result-source agent --json
papertiger decompose <N> --outline-file outline.json --start-ready --json
```

Split a multi-part outcome into child tasks with one `decompose` call instead
of inventing section or phase labels. Refer to local work by task number inside
Papertiger and by its outcome everywhere else.

Read rejected history before reviving an approach. Choose `user`, `agent`, or
`external` for the actual source of intent. An intent stands alone: fold a
source plan's substance in (`--intent-file`) instead of citing a scratch file.
Write `--why` for choices a cold
reader could question. Record a decision with `note --text "..." --task <N>`.
`--intent-file`, `--why-file`, `--result-file`, and `note --text-file` read
UTF-8 text when shell quoting becomes awkward.

Don't truncate JSON with head/tail; use `--compact`, `--no-history` or
`--limit`. New task numbers are in `events[].task.seq`. If output handling
fails after a successful mutation, check with `show`/`log`; never replay it.

Before completion, record any commit that represents the outcome with
`commit add <N> <full-oid>` (add `--repo <label>` only for a nested or external
repository). Keep task numbers out of shared Git/PR prose. Probes and decisions
require results; `done` refuses open obligations. Resolve them with evidence,
never route around a refusal. Run `audit` after planning changes.

Use live `--help` for operations. Read [the reference](../../../tools/papertiger/agent_integration.md)
for authority changes, migration or recovery; its relevant section
covers gates, transfers, external references and optional Mise. Only `init`
initializes or migrates a database; never use it to replace missing history.
